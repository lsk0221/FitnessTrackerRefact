## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Files Created

### 1. **Type Definitions**
- **File**: `src/features/workouts/types/workout.types.ts`
- **Purpose**: Defines all TypeScript interfaces for workout data structures
- **Key Types**:
  - `Workout` - Single workout record interface
  - `WorkoutInput` - Input data for creating workouts
  - `WorkoutUpdate` - Input data for updating workouts
  - `WorkoutDataByDate` - Grouped workout data by date
  - `WorkoutServiceResult<T>` - Service operation result wrapper
  - `ValidationResult` - Validation result interface

### 2. **Business Logic / Service Layer**
- **File**: `src/features/workouts/services/workoutService.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handles all workout-related business logic and data operations
- **Key Functions**:
  - `loadWorkouts()` - Load all workouts with automatic migration
  - `saveWorkout()` - Create new workout with validation
  - `updateWorkout()` - Update existing workout
  - `deleteWorkout()` - Delete workout by ID
  - `clearAllWorkouts()` - Clear all workout data
  - `getWorkoutsByExercise()` - Filter workouts by exercise
  - `getLastWorkoutByExercise()` - Get most recent workout for exercise
  - `getAvailableExercises()` - Get list of all exercises
  - `convertAllWorkouts()` - Convert weight units for all workouts
  - `queryWorkouts()` - Query workouts with multiple filters
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Automatic data migration support
  - ✅ Multi-user support (user-specific storage keys)
  - ✅ Comprehensive error handling
  - ✅ Data validation
  - ✅ Unit conversion handling

### 3. **State Management Hook**
- **File**: `src/features/workouts/hooks/useWorkoutHistory.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages all state and logic for the HistoryScreen
- **Key Features**:
  - Data state management (workouts, selected date, etc.)
  - UI state management (loading, modals, etc.)
  - Edit form state management
  - CRUD operation handlers
  - Date selection and filtering
  - Pull-to-refresh functionality
  - Auto-reload on screen focus
- **Return Values**: 20+ state variables and handler functions

### 4. **UI Components**

#### a. WorkoutCalendar Component
- **File**: `src/features/workouts/components/WorkoutCalendar.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Wraps the shared Calendar component with workout-specific logic
- **Features**:
  - Calendar display with workout indicators
  - Muscle group legend
  - Date selection handling

#### b. WorkoutList Component
- **File**: `src/features/workouts/components/WorkoutList.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Displays a list of workouts for a selected date
- **Features**:
  - Workout item cards with muscle group tags
  - Edit and delete action buttons
  - Empty state handling
  - Scrollable list with max height

#### c. WorkoutDetailModal Component
- **File**: `src/features/workouts/components/WorkoutDetailModal.tsx`

  - Theme-aware styling

### 5. **Screen Component**
- **File**: `src/features/workouts/screens/HistoryScreen.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Clean container component that orchestrates all workout history functionality
- **Architecture**:
  - Uses `useWorkoutHistory` hook for all business logic
  - Renders `WorkoutCalendar` and `WorkoutDetailModal` components
  - Handles pull-to-refresh
  - Minimal component logic (< 100 lines)
- **Props Flow**: Passes all necessary state and handlers from hook to child components
